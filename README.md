# Shopping_List
My first website with JavaScript!

This is my first time using JavaScript and I love it. Reminds me of the Java GUI I made in my second year computer science class.
Some of this websites features include:
  - new items can be addes to your shop listing by typing them in the input bar, then you can press 'ENTER' or hit the 'Submit' button
  - if you click on an item, for example 'Notebook', it will cross the item off
  - if you click on the delete button next to an item it will full remove the item from the list
